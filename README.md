# GenAI-Powered Financial Advisory Report

## Overview

This project aims to develop a GenAI-powered financial advisory report system for banking customers. By leveraging customer transactional data and other financial details, the system generates personalized financial advisory reports. The project follows an iterative Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model to ensure continuous improvement and integration of feedback.

## Project Workflow

### Iteration 1: Initial Implementation

#### Data Points
1. **Demographic Data**: Age, gender, marital status, number of dependents, etc.
2. **Income Data**: Salary, bonuses, other income sources.
3. **Expense Categories**: Housing, transportation, groceries, utilities, education, healthcare, entertainment, etc.
4. **Debt Information**: Loans, credit card balances, mortgage details, etc.
5. **Savings and Investments**: Current savings, investment portfolios, retirement accounts, etc.
6. **Credit Score**: Insights into financial health and borrowing capacity.
7. **Financial Goals**: Customer's short-term and long-term financial goals.
8. **Historical Transaction Data**: Past transactions to identify spending patterns.
9. **Risk Tolerance**: Customer's risk appetite for investments.
10. **Economic Indicators**: Inflation rate, interest rates, and other relevant economic factors.

#### Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess all necessary data points.
2. **Analysis**: Perform initial analysis on spending patterns, income trends, and savings capacity.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Use ML models to project future income, expenses, and savings.
4. **Report Generation**: Feed the analysis and projections into GenAI (using OpenAI API) to generate the report.

### Iteration 2: Feedback Integration

#### Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess all necessary data points.
2. **Analysis**: Perform initial analysis on spending patterns, income trends, and savings capacity.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Use ML models to project future income, expenses, and savings.
4. **Report Generation**: Feed the analysis and projections into GenAI to generate the report.
5. **Feedback Integration**: Collect feedback and refine the model and report generation process.

### Iteration 3: Fine-Tuning GenAI

#### Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess all necessary data points.
2. **Analysis**: Perform initial analysis on spending patterns, income trends, and savings capacity.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Use ML models to project future income, expenses, and savings.
4. **Report Generation**: Feed the analysis and projections into GenAI to generate the report.
5. **Feedback Integration**: Collect feedback and refine the model and report generation process.
6. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the OpenAI model using relevant financial data and historical reports.

### Iteration 4: Model Improvements

#### Enhancements
1. **Holistic Analysis**:
    - **Behavioral Analysis**: Beyond transaction data, analyze behavioral patterns. For example, spending changes during different economic conditions or life events.
    - **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict future expenses and income changes, providing a more accurate savings projection.

2. **Personalization**:
    - Customize the advisory report based on individual customer preferences and goals. Personalization will increase the report's relevance and value.

3. **Interactive Reports**:
    - Consider making the reports interactive. Allow customers to modify assumptions (like rate of return, expense growth rate) and see how it affects their financial future.

4. **Continuous Learning**:
    - Implement a feedback loop where customer feedback on the reports is used to improve the model continuously.

5. **Compliance and Ethics**:
    - Ensure the advisory recommendations comply with financial regulations and ethical standards.

6. **Visualization**:
    - Use visual aids like graphs and charts to make the report more understandable and engaging.

7. **Data Privacy**:
    - Ensure data privacy and security measures are in place, especially when handling sensitive financial information.

## Technology Stack

- **GenAI**: OpenAI API for generating advisory reports.
